# pandas-challenge-1

**This is my repository for the Module 4 Challenge, "pandas-challenge-1". I entered my code into the "module_4_challenge" Jupyter file. I felt like this challenge was a bit easier than the last two (maybe I'm progressing, maybe pandas is just easier ðŸ˜›), however I did have a little trouble with some parts. Overall, I felt pretty good manipulating the data with pandas though.**
